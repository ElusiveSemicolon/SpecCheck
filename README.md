To setup the Django server and run it, run the following commands inside the src folder where manage.py is located:

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Make sure pip is installed and, if necessary:

```bash
$ pip install django
$ pip install django-machina
$ pip install django-braces
$ pip install django-bootstrap3
$ pip install misaka
```
